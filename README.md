# Networking-Assignment-Release
Welcome to the Networking Assignment! 

This is one of the customized projects in IoT Summer Camp under WYSE atUIUC.

Have you ever wondered how your application communicates with the server? 
Have you ever heard of the OSI Model? 
Join our networking project and learn more about them, as networking plays a crucial role in the Internet of Things (IoT) and it is ubiquitous in daily life. 
In our networking project, we will talk about application-layer protocols in networking, for example, HTTP. 
Also, you will learn to use C language and implement an application-layer protocol similar to HTTP but more simplified.
